This project was built with Jest for learn how tests work in server-side of NodeJS

## Description

The objectives of this are the following:

- Learn to write tests for a NodeJS application using Jest. These library are commonly used in production for testing NodeJS applications.

- To practice reading over and understanding code which you did not write, but that you do need to test.

## Initialization and Setup

You can run the complete application by installing Node modules with the `npm` command, and then running `npm start`.

Run `npm run test` in order to run the test suite.
